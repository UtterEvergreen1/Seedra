/**
 * @file enchantRegistry.hpp
 * @brief Declares the EnchantRegistry class which manages and orders available enchantments.
 *
 * @details
 * The EnchantRegistry class is responsible for managing all available enchantments. It stores both the
 * complete list of registered enchantments and a subset of "active" enchantments sorted according to a given
 * console/version ordering. The registry provides methods to:
 * - Retrieve the active enchantments and their weights.
 * - Look up enchantments and weights by their unique identifier.
 * - Apply an ordering based on a lookup table.
 * - Initialize (and reinitialize) the registry as needed.
 *
 * The registry relies on static pre-constructed enchantment objects defined in enchantsInit.hpp.
